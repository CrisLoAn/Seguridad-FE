# Ytnest-Front


Yt-Nest was born from the need to generate an automated system for the application,
delivery, abdication and relocation of university residences to the students of the Universidad de Investigación de T  ́ecnologia Experimental Yachay Yech. This is the first version of the web service that serves as a replacement for the manual assignment process currently carried out by university welfare department. Which in broad strokes sets YT-Nest as an entirely new software in the college. The context where the software would be run is crucial for the university due to that the number of students grow semester by semester, thus is important to be implemented because the hourly load for any employee at the assignment moment would still growing with the students numbers from there on it is evident that the software would do the same work in seconds and there is where its importance lies on.
